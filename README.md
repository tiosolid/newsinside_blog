# NewsInside.org custom themes and plugins

In this repository you can find all the custom code I made for the NewsInside old blog. Nothing fancy, just a widget plugin and a theme.

## The Theme

The theme was made using bootstrap 3. You can just install and use it. No custom code or modification needed.

## The Podcast Widget

This file requires some custom fields in your database. It will filter posts from a specific category, extract the custom field data and print it inside the widget.

The theme contains code from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). All rights reserved.
